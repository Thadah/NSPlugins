# NutScript 1.1-Beta Plugin Repository

## Loot Container Plugin (former World Item Container)

This plugin will spawn a list of items inside a container for players to find and loot.
The spawns are set using the command `/lootaddspawn <path model>`.

You can add new item rarities in sh_rarity.lua, new item categories in sh_categories.lua and new container models in sh_containermodels.lua.

All other configurations can be done inside NutScript.
